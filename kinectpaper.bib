@article{Apple1990,
abstract = {Given the increasing power of conservative movements in the larger society, there is considerable pressure currently not only to redefine the manner in which education is carried out, but to redefine what education is actually for This has had a major impact on teachers' autonomy and the definition of what counts as a skill. We argue that teaching is a specific kind of labor process, one that is currently being subject to rationalization, deskilling and intensification. Since teaching has historically been seen as largely "women's paid work," the gender implications of such tendencies are crucial. By interpreting teaching in gender and labor process terms, we report data from an ethnographic study of the use of a computer literacy curriculum to illuminate the effects of these tendencies on teachers' daily lives. In this context, teachers often employed a prepackaged curriculum that deskilled them and frequently left them bored and reliant on outside experts and purchased material. Yet they also employed the curriculum for their own purposes, using it to partly solve the problems caused by their intense schedule and work load. This pragmatic response cannot be understood unless the gendered realities of teachers' work inside and outside of the school are recognized.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an interactive display system guided by a human observer's gesture, facial pose, and facial expression. The Kinect depth sensor is used to detect and track an observer's skeletal joints while the RGB camera is used for detailed facial analysis. The display consists of active regions that the observer can manipulate with body gestures and secluded regions that are activated through head pose and facial expression. The observer receives realtime feedback allowing for intuitive navigation of the interface. A storefront interactive display was created and feedback was collected from over one hundred subjects. Promising results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for human-computer interaction applications.},

@article{Bjørneseth2012,
abstract = {Multi-touch interaction, in particular multi-touch gestureinteraction, is widely believed to give a more natural interaction style. We investigated the utility of multi-touch interaction in the safetycritical domain of maritime dynamic positioning (DP) vessels. We conducted initial paper prototyping with domain experts to gain an insight into natural gestures; we then conducted observational studies aboard a DP vessel during operational duties and two rounds of formal evaluation of prototypes—the second on a motion platform ship simulator. Despite following a careful user-centred design process, the final results show that traditional touch-screen button and menu interaction was quicker and less erroneous than gestures. Furthermore, the moving environment accentuated this difference and we observed initial use problems and handedness asymmetries on some multi-touch gestures. On the positive side, our results showed that users were able to suspend gestural interaction more naturally, thus improving situational awareness.},

In general, speech input has proven helpful whenever optimal task performance requires the intensive coordination of the user's hands and eyes. For many people with disabilities, alternate access to computers through speech recognition technology holds the promise of lessening their dependence on others and promoting the development of their adaptive abilities. In this article, the importance of alternate access for persons with disabilities and the ways in which speech recognition technology has been used to accomplish this goal are discussed. Illustrative studies of the use of speech recognition by persons with disabilities are reviewed, and implications for the effective application of this technology are described.},

Inspired by gestures used in two representative human-to-human control areas, we consider a set of oscillatory motions and refine from them a 24 gesture lexicon. Each gesture is modeled as a dynamical system with added geometric constraints to allow for real time gesture recognition using a small amount of processing time and memory. The gestures are used to control a pan-tilt camera neck. We propose extensions for use in areas such as mobile robot control and telerobotics},

abstract = {By incorporating educational games and other applications into the traditional classroom, technology-enhanced learning environments offer an alternative way of teaching that encourages students to learn lessons in an engaging and enjoyable manner. However, school teachers are less likely to adopt a technology-based learning system since they are intimated by software with its learning curve and afraid that students are more knowledgeable in its use. This motivated us to develop a software tool that runs on a mobile device and enables teachers to supervise a technology-enhanced learning environment in an easy and comfortable manner. The tool empowers the teacher to control student learning devices and monitor them in real-time. Emphasis was put on the usability to minimize the learning curve in order to maximize its potential adoption for use. Evaluation results indicate promising features of the tool and points of improvement to increase its acceptance.},

abstract = {The concept of a real-time range camera without moving parts is described, based on the time-of-flight (TOF) principle. It operates with modulated visible and near-infrared radiation, which is detected and demodulated simultaneously by a 2-D array of lock-in pixels employing the charge-coupled device principle. Each pixel individually measures the amplitude, offset and phase of the received radiation. The theoretical resolution limit of this TOF range camera is derived, which depends on the square root of the detected background radiation and the inverse of the modulation amplitude. Actual measurements of 3-D sequences acquired at 10 range images per second show excellent agreement between our theory and the observed results. A range resolution of a few centimeters over a range of 10 m, with an illumination power of a few hundreds of milliwatts is obtained in laboratory scenes for noncooperative, diffusely reflecting objects},

In order to determine its suitability for our applications, we devised and conducted tests to measure standard performance specifications for tracking systems. We evaluated the noise, accuracy, resolution, and latency of the skeleton tracking software. We also measured the range in which the person being tracked must be in order to achieve these values.},

abstract = {We present a method for reducing interference between multiple structured light-based depth sensors operating in the same spectrum with rigidly attached projectors and cameras. A small amount of motion is applied to a subset of the sensors so that each unit sees its own projected pattern sharply, but sees a blurred version of the patterns of other units. If high spacial frequency patterns are used, each sensor sees its own pattern with higher contrast than the patterns of other units, resulting in simplified pattern disambiguation. An analysis of this method is presented for a group of commodity Microsoft Kinect color-plus-depth sensors with overlapping views. We demonstrate that applying a small vibration with a simple motor to a subset of the Kinect sensors results in reduced interference, as manifested as holes and noise in the depth maps. Using an array of six Kinects, our system reduced interference-related missing data from from 16.6\% to 1.4\% of the total pixels. Another experiment with three Kinects showed an 82.2\% percent reduction in the measurement error introduced by interference. A side-effect is blurring in the color images of the moving units, which is mitigated with post-processing. We believe our technique will allow inexpensive commodity depth sensors to form the basis of dense large-scale capture systems.},

While dictation software has so far been used predominantly in the medical and legal professions, it has been suggested that the software may benefit schoolchildren who have difficulties with spelling and writing. This paper reports on an exploratory study in which a group of second year secondary school pupils with reading ages ranging from 8.3 to 12.9 performed a set of tasks using the IBM VoiceType dictation package. The tasks involved normal classroom dictation by a teacher, the use of the keyboard to input the same text, the use of the dictation software to dictate the text to the computer, and the use of the dictation software to write a story based on a set of pictures. The results showed that the children could input text more quickly using voice dictation compared with keyboard entry, and that accuracy was acceptable and improving with practice. The implications of these findings for the use of dictation software in the classroom are discussed alongwith some directions for further research.},

The first device, called GestureWrist, is a wristband-type input device that recognizes hand gestures and forearm movements. Unlike DataGloves or other hand gesture-input devices, all sensing elements are embedded in a normal wristband. The second device, called GesturePad, is a sensing module that can be attached on the inside of clothes, and users can interact with this module from the outside.

The first prototype implemented an interface with a virtual keyboard and mouse in order to remotely manage the classroom server and its peripherals. Additionally other features were included, such a remote video projector control and an agenda application. However, users had problems with regard to direct text introduction and mouse sensibility. Knowledge of the domain was acquired from experts in the field of education, and as a result, a new set of project requirements were defined and a second version of the interface has been developed. Its task-oriented design improves usability through minimizing the need for a virtual keyboard and mouse utilization. This system is currently in use in two classrooms in our university.},

abstract = {Recently developed depth-sensing video camera technologies provide precise per-pixel range data in addition to color video. Such cameras will find application in robotics and vision-based human computer interaction scenarios such as games and gesture input systems. We present an interactive tabletop system which uses a depth-sensing camera to build a height map of the objects on the table surface. This height map is used in a driving simulation game that allows players to drive a virtual car over real objects placed on the table. Players can use folded bits of paper, for example, to lay out a course of ramps and other obstacles. A projector displays the position of the car on the surface, such that when the car is driven over a ramp, for example, it jumps appropriately. A second display shows a synthetic graphical view of the entire surface, or a traditional arcade view from behind the car. Micromotorcross is a fun initial investigation into the applicability of depth-sensing cameras to tabletop interfaces. We present details on its implementation, and speculate on how this technology will enable new tabletop interactions.},

abstract = {Conventional human detection is mostly done in images taken by visible-light cameras. These methods imitate the detection process that human use. They use features based on gradients, such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG), or extract interest points in the image, such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), etc. In this paper, we present a novel human detection method using depth information taken by the Kinect for Xbox 360. We propose a model based approach, which detects humans using a 2-D head contour model and a 3-D head surface model. We propose a segmentation scheme to segment the human from his/her surroundings and extract the whole contours of the figure based on our detection point. We also explore the tracking algorithm based on our detection result. The methods are tested on our database taken by the Kinect in our lab and present superior results.},

abstract = {We present a new post-processing step to enhance the resolution of range images. Using one or two registered and potentially high-resolution color images as reference, we iteratively refine the input low-resolution range image, in terms of both its spatial resolution and depth precision. Evaluation using the Middlebury benchmark shows across-the-board improvement for sub-pixel accuracy. We also demonstrated its effectiveness for spatial resolution enhancement up to 100 times with a single reference image.},

@article{Zhu2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we address natural human-robot interaction (HRI) in a smart assisted living (SAIL) system for the elderly and the disabled. Two common HRI problems are studied: hand gesture recognition and daily activity recognition. For hand gesture recognition, we implemented a neural network for gesture spotting and a hierarchical hidden Markov model for context-based recognition. For daily activity recognition, a multisensor fusion scheme is developed to process motion data collected from the foot and the waist of a human subject. Experiments using a prototype wearable sensor system show the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithms.},
